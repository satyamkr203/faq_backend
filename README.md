## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js & npm**: Download and install from [here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Redis** (for caching): Install Redis from [here](https://redis.io/download)
- **Docker** (Optional for containerization): Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### **Steps to Run Locally**

1. **Clone the repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/faq-backend.git
   cd faq-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.  
   Add necessary configurations such as database connection, Redis URL, and API keys. Example:
   ```env
   DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/faqdb
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   ```

4. **Set up Redis**  
   Make sure Redis is installed and running. The app will connect to Redis for caching.  
   You can start Redis by running:
   ```sh
   redis-server
   ```

5. **Start the application**  
   After setting up the environment, you can start the application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The app should now be running locally on `http://localhost:8000`.

6. **Run tests**  
   If you want to run the tests to ensure everything is working correctly, use:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

GET /api/faqs/?lang=hi   # Fetch FAQs in Hindi
GET /api/faqs/?lang=bn   # Fetch FAQs in Bengali
```

#### **Create a FAQ**
```sh
POST /api/faqs/
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "question": "What is Node.js?",
    "answer": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime.",
    "language": "en"
}
```

#### **Update a FAQ**
```sh
PUT /api/faqs/:id
Content-Type: application/json
